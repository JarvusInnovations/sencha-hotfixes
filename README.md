# sencha-hotfixes

Provides a jarvus-hotfixes package for each ExtJS / Sencha Touch version containing all hotfixes managed by Jarvus Innovations. These packages strictly contains *only* overrides that restore framework components to their intended/documented behavior, and do not add features or opinionate framework usage. Our intention is that these packages be safe to include in every project from the start to save developers from going down framework bug rabbit-holes that have already been gone down.

## Using hotfixes
This repository has separate branches for each framework+version, with the master branch serving as a template for new branches.

### Step 1) Clone a branch into your <kbd>packages</kbd> folder
Open a terminal in your app's or workspace's <kbd>packages</kbd> directory and clone the branch for the framework+version you're using into a directory called <kbd>jarvus-hotfixes</kbd>:

  `git clone -b touch/2/4/1/527 https://github.com/JarvusInnovations/sencha-hotfixes.git jarvus-hotfixes`

### Step 2) Add package to app's requirements
Open the <kbd>app.json</kbd> file in your app's directory and add `"jarvus-hotfixes"` to the array following the existing `"requires"` attribute:

```json
    "requires": [
        "jarvus-hotfixes"
    ],
```

### Step 3) Refresh bootstrap.js
In order for the overrides contained in the package to be automatically loaded by our app, the <kbd>bootstrap.js</kbd> file generated by Sencha CMD must be updated after adding a new package to the app's `"requires"` config. Run this from your app's directory:

  `sencha app refresh`
